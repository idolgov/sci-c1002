# SCI-C1002 User-driven product development project: Lapsipaimen

![Tests](https://github.com/idolgov/sci-c1002/actions/workflows/test.yaml/badge.svg)

An early prototype of a vibration bracelet for helping parents to stress less
about kids getting lost, developed as part of the SCI-C1002 course of Aalto
University.

## Features

- Startup
  - Short haptic feedback
  - Blink cyan LED once
  - Start connecting or waiting for a connection
  - Device is initially in alert state

- Peripherial device is nearby
  - Blink blue LED every 4-5s
  - Disable haptic alert if it is on

- Peripherial device is too far away
  - Enable haptic alert
  - Blink yellow LED every second

- Action button short press
  - Turn the device on
  - Toggle vibration but don't disable alert state
  - Print device info

- Turn the device off on action button long press

- Calculate approximate distance
  - Distance == 10^((Measured power â€“ RSSI)/(10 * N))
    - Measured power == 1m RSSI of the BLE chip
    - N == environmental factor, 2-4

- Low battery indicator
  - Threshold for low battery currently 3.6 V
  - Blink red LED instead of blue every 4-5s when voltage too low

### TODO

- [ ] Peripheral device: alert when not connected

## Development

To download and install CircuitPython firmware and required drivers using a
Linux machine plug a device in with a USB cable and run:

    make firmware
    make flash
    
> In case of multiple connected devices define `BOOTLOADER_PATH` env var.

Before uploading new code to the device, check it for formatting and some other
errors, you'll need to create a python virtual environment with dependencies
first:

    make env
    make lint

Now install the code and required libraries on the device:

    make install
    
> In case of multiple connected devices define `CIRCUITPYTHON_PATH` env var.
